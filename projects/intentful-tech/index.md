_Roles: Founder_

_Status: Active Organization_

Our purpose is to strengthen the technological capacity and digital literacy of equity and justice-based organizations. Together, we build technology for the public good and cultivate a learning ecosystem of technologists, public-sector professionals, and community partners.

Currently, we do this through engaging in pro bono tech projects for community-based organizations in New York and elsewhere. Learn more about us <a href="https://www.intentfultech.org/">**here**</a>.
