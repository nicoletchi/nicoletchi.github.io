The world is facing multiple global crises: climate change, forced migration, the erosion of liberal democracy, rising inequality, and more. Meanwhile, for the first time in human history, we have the technology to link national and global trends, and learn from each other in real-time and at global scale. This project aims to explore these emerging technologies and their potential role in strengthening civil society. 

We are partnering with Build Belonging, an initiative that is working on bridging people and organizations across disciplines to address the growing sense that the only way out of the crises mentioned above is by working together. Through Build Belonging’s work, one theme that has continuously popped up is the question over the relationship between online and offline organizing, and how a “network of networks” can leverage technology to deepen connection and improve our ability to reach global population scale.

Our group is interested in exploring technologies applied in a broad range of use cases that might be helpful to creating a decentralized, collaborative community/network. Examples include HR tech, technologies that are being used in participatory democracy, and more.
