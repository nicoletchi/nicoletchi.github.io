Hello there! I'm a UC Berkeley School of Information graduate student whose experience bridges the technology, social impact, and policy space. In the past two years, I launched a program and then an organization that helps nonprofits and technologists collaboratively design technology for the public good. My efforts have catalyzed over $1 million in pro bono tech services to nonprofit partners. 

I am a design and partnerships strategist with deep operational experience, having also worked in consulting to advise 30+ technology startups on building the right processes and teams to scale rapidly and sustainably. Last year, I completed a fellowship in DC where I studied future of work and AI policy at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a transatlantic think tank. 

At UC Berkeley, my studies focus on social computing, product management, and trust & safety. My superpower is drawing connections and expertise across diverse disciplines. Check out what I'm working on under the "Projects" tab!
