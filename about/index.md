Hello there! I'm a product manager with a passion for creating digital products that support the world we want to live in -- products that are not only delightful, but also mitigate the risks of harmful user behavior and support the needs of people who are historically underserved by technology. In the past few years, I've worked in public interest tech, sustainability, policy, and ethical ML. 

I'm a UC Berkeley School of Information graduate student (graduating May '22). While at Berkeley, I launched PlatformAbuse.org, a Mozilla-backed product that aims to create a centralized source of knowledge about tech harms and mitigations. I am currently working on TikTok UnWrapped, a ML education tool to help people make sense of how their TikTok algorithm affects their identity and emotions. I've also published work diversity and inclusion in ML ethics, facilitated workshops to guide policy and product recommendations for social media companies, and helped ADL build responsible content moderation tools for hate speech. 

Prior to my graduate degree, I worked numerous roles in product, strategy, and partnerships. Most recently, I was the first product manager for TerraMatch, a restoration platform developed at the World Resources Institute that serves organizations from 76 countries. In New York, I launched a pro bono tech program at Civic Hall that catalyzed over $1 million in pro bono tech services to nonprofits.  I've also conducted research on future of work and AI policy at the Bertelsmann Foundation, and been a consultant for early to growth stage tech companies. 

Outside of work, I love longboarding, fantasy adventure novels, and am trying to learn bachata. Reach out if you'd like to chat!
